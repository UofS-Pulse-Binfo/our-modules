This site showcases the Tripal modules that the University of Saskatchewan, Pulse Bioinformatics group has developed for use on KnowPulse with sharing in mind. These modules were developed on a generic Tripal site and have been designed to be customized and generic.

## About the UofS, Pulse Bioinformatics group

Our group is based out of the University of Saskatchewan in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, Canada. We work for a group of Pulse breeders under the direct lead of Dr. Kirstin Bett on KnowPulse, a breeder-friendly pulse web portal.

## About this Showcase

Tripal Showcase is a Jekyll site originally developed by the Bradford Condon with the Staton Lab to make finding modules easy. The cards layout was adapted [from Webjeda](https://github.com/sharu725/cards) and utilizes bootstrap. LaceySanderson has adapted it to the needs of the University of Saskatchewan, Pulse Bioinformatics Group.
